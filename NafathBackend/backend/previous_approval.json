Geographic separation between requester (Dammam) and approver (Riyadh) is consistent with the citizen\u2019s past behaviour but still slightly increases coordination risk. Approval came from a familiar city and a device pattern that fits the user\u2019s historical approvals, and all user-supplied data matches official records. Taken together, there are a few moderate anomalies but no reinforcing high-risk cluster. Probability of impersonation is assessed as moderate, not high.\",\n  \"analysis_confidence\": 65\n}"
